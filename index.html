          "I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? <br>
           I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race—that rarely do I ever simply estimate it." <br>

       <p >Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits
        a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a
        higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a
        suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the
        noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck.</p>
